Ein frischer Bogen blaues Papier wartet gespannt in der
Schreibmaschine, wartet nur darauf, von meinen Worten bepinselt zu
werden, während Chopin sanft auf der Platte kratzt. Es ist
Dienstagabend, zum Schreiben habe ich Grenzen gezogen: Ein Abend
in Rausch und Kerzenschein, mal wieder bei sich sein, Absagen
erteilen an alle lieben Ablenkungen. Wie wohltuend es doch ist,
endlich alleine zu sein und dabei doch in Gesellschaft eines
ungeduldigen Blattes und einer Maschine, die nach Berührung lechzt.
Es ist wie Nachhause kommen, obschon mein Herz heimatlos bleibt.
Nur der Wind kennt meinen Namen. Doch ich schreibe ohne Namen,
schreibe unbeständig wie der Wind, schreibe mich frei.</p>

<p>Ich wandle durch eine Heimat ohne Grenzen, in der die Fremde lebt.
Ich streiche durch ein Reich der tausend Bilder: Durch einen
Dschungel smaragdgrüner Vögel, die in knisternden Bauchhöhlen
nisten; durch eine Höhle hinter der Iris: kalt, schwarz und bodenlos.
Da noch kauernd, bald schon fliegend, schwinge ich mich über die
Dächer und Sterne und Seelen empor, bis ich schließlich ganz Musik
werde.</p>

<p>Klickklack Klickklack Bing.</p>

<p>Ich tippe den Takt, der Takt bin ich und ich fließe, ströme und flöße dem Papier Leben, der Maschine meinen Rhythmus ein. Ich stifte Leben, so viel lautes Leben tief in mir, das Leben das bin. Hier bin ich ganz Gott, mit verschwommenem Blick schreibe ich, tippe ich, hämmere ich, bis sich das Ich zersetzt, nur noch Hülle, Kokon ist, aus dem sich die Art, der Stil, das Selbst entpuppt. Bis ich Mensch schließlich ganz zu Rhythmus, ganz zu Wort zerfließe. Mein Fleisch zersetzt sich, löst sich vom Knochen, bis ich nur noch Hülle bin, die das Selbst nicht zu halten vermag, so impulsiv drängt die Intuition in die Poren des Papiers, so frei strömt ein Wille in die Macht meiner Wörter.</p>

<p>Beinahe ist mir, als ob die Wörter sich selber finden. Als seien sie Vertraute aus früheren Leben, die sich erinnern, zwischen welchen Partnern es ihnen besonders behagt. Ich höre ihnen zu, bin geduldig und biegsam, biete ihnen Leerzeichen zum neu verlieben. Ich bin nichts außer Medium durch das die Magie der Emotionen, der Zauber eines entzündeten Herzens hindurchströmt. Der Tod des Autors? Er ist real und ich suizidiere mich Takt um Takt, Taste um Taste, Klickklack Klickklack Bling.</p>


<p>Bis mein Herz explodiert und die Nacht mich verschluckt.</p>
<p>Klickklack Klickklack bling.</p>

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
